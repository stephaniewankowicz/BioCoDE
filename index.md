# BioCoDE

<br>
The Biomedical and Computational Discovery Experience (BioCoDE) is an opportunity for high school students to explore what biomedical research is. 


*Our Mission* is to provide a low-bar opportunity for students with no background in  to get a flavor of what, how, why, and who of biomedical research.



This experience is geared towards students with no background or experience in biomedical research and who want to get a taste of what biomedical research is all about. It is two week, hands-on research experience at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Learn more here.
