# BioCoDE!

<br>
The Biomedical and Computational Discovery Experience (BioCoDE) is an opportunity for high school students to explore what biomedical research is. This experience is geared towards students with no background or experience in biomedical research and who want to get a taste of what biomedical research is all about. Learn more about the program here.

This is a two week, hands-on research experience at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). 


*Our Mission* is to provide a low-bar opportunity for students with no background in  to get a flavor of what, how, why, and who of biomedical research.
